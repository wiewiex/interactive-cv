          On request of the charity foundation helping the Ukrainian artists
          during the war, I created a website based on React in Next.js. I got
          very involved in this project and developed a lot being able to
          incorporate possibilities that Next.js offers, together with Wordpress
          as Headless CMS. Problems that I encountered made me explore new
          solutions and implement improvements. I learned the integration with
          various API, deployment in GitHub Actions. What’s more, I created my
          first container in Docker and learned how to search StackOverflow more
          efficiently.

          At the beginning of pandemic I founded a company offering online music
          classes. Marketing agency and a graphic designer were engaged in this
          project. I created a website using Wordpress and WooCommerce, took
          responsibility for customer service, employed music teachers and took
          care of organizational matters.
